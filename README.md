# BIND Online - An Immersive E-Commerce Experience

### Project Description
The FEC Capstone is our cohort's project within Hack Reactor's Senior Phase curriculum; and allows us, as a team of 4, to work modularly and to some extent independently, towards creating a cohesive web application with a number of specifications provided by our "client".

With a pre-provided backend service, aspects and control of the backend have been abstracted, and the scope of the project remains purely frontend.
____________
### Initialization

In order to compile the application and create the bundle:
1. Run `npm install` to install application depencies,
2. Use the command `npm run build-dev` to bundle the source files with Webpack,
3. Start the server, using the command `npm start`. You can now access the site at http://localhost:5000.
