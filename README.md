# BIND Online - An Immersive E-Commerce Experience

### Project Description
The FEC Capstone is our cohort's project within Hack Reactor's Senior Phase curriculum; and allows us, as a team of 4, to work modularly and to some extent independently, towards creating a cohesive web application with a number of specifications provided by our "client".

While an external API was provided by the client, we implemented a local server in order to serve the frontend files, as well as to proxy the requests to the client's API. Aside from this, aspects and control of the backend have been abstracted, and the scope of the project remains almost entirely frontend.

### Initialization

In order to compile the application and create the bundle:
1. Run `npm install` to install application depencies,
2. Use the command `npm run build-dev` to bundle the source files with Webpack,
3. Start the server, using the command `npm run server-dev`. You can now access the site at http://localhost:5000.
